Customer Retention & Churn Analysis (Telco)
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying the key drivers of customer churn for a subscription-based Telecommunications company. By analyzing customer demographics, account information, and service usage, I have developed a data-driven strategy to improve retention rates and increase Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

🎯 Business Goals
Identify High-Risk Segments: Which customers are most likely to leave?

Uncover Churn Drivers: Why are they leaving? (e.g., pricing, contract types, or service issues).

Actionable Strategy: Provide concrete recommendations to the Product and Growth teams to reduce churn.

📊 The Dataset
The analysis is based on the Telco Customer Churn dataset, containing information on 7,043 customers.

Target Variable: Churn (Customers who left within the last month).

Features: Services (Fiber Optic, Online Security, etc.), Account Info (Contract, Payment Method, Tenure), and Demographics.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Data Cleaning: Python (Pandas) / Power BI Power Query

Analysis: Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Dashboarding: Power BI Desktop

Documentation: Markdown

📈 Key Insights & Dashboard
1. The "Contract" Effect
Insight: Customers on Month-to-month contracts have a churn rate of over 40%, compared to <7% for two-year contracts.

Recommendation: Incentivize long-term commitments through "Loyalty Discounts" or value-added bundles.

2. The First-Year "Danger Zone"
Insight: The highest volume of churn occurs within the first 12 months of tenure.

Recommendation: Implement a 90-day "Customer Success" onboarding program to ensure users are finding value early.

3. Service-Specific Friction
Insight: Fiber Optic users churn at a significantly higher rate than DSL users, despite paying a premium. This indicates a potential gap in service quality or price-to-value perception.

Recommendation: Conduct a technical audit of Fiber service stability and offer complimentary "Tech Support" for high-tier plans.

💡 Practical Recommendations for the Business
Switch to Auto-Pay: Customers using Electronic Checks churned at nearly 2x the rate of those on Automatic Bank Transfers. Offer a $2 monthly credit for switching to Auto-Pay.

Bundle "Sticky" Services: Customers with Online Security and Tech Support had significantly lower churn rates. Focus marketing efforts on bundling these into basic packages.
